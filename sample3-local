Drawbacks: Using this age formula in Excel produces pretty accurate results, but not flawless. 
Dividing by the average number of days in a year works fine most of the time, but sometimes it gets the age wrong. For example, if someone was born on February 29 and today is February 28, 
the formula will make a person one day older.
